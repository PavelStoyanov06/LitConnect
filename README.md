# LitConnect
A virtual book club platform that allows users to create or join clubs, share reading lists (WIP), participate in discussions, and track their reading progress.
The Project is not yet complete, although if you would like to start it, you can just add the following to either appsettings.json (LitConnect.Web), or as a user secret:
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "[YourConnectionString]"
  }
}
